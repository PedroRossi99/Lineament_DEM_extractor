# Lineament_DEM_extractor
This code extracts topographic lineaments from SRTM DEM data
With the objective of predicting topographic lineaments in SRTM data we adopted a deep-learning semantic segmentation approach, by training a convolutional neural network in a supervised workflow. We chose a U-Net architecture (Ronnenberger et al., 2015) for the network, and Pytorch as the development framework.
